<h2>📝Description</h2>


<h3>In response to the current demand for technological solutions that address the challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, our team is pleased to present the front-end development project of a Covid-19 Dashboard imitation.

This project's main objective is to provide an interactive and visually attractive platform that allows users to access and analyze relevant data on the behavior of the disease, including the number of infections, recovered people and vaccinated people.

It is the exact reproduction of a React-based web application that allows users to view the most recent data related to Covid-19 in an intuitive and understandable way. Through this Dashboard, we seek to provide an effective tool for analyzing the situation and making informed decisions.</h3>
